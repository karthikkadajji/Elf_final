bitweaving-lib

The code implements a library for performing efficient scanning queries 
over column oriented data stores.

### Usage ###

To write a program using Bitweaving lib, compile Bitweaving lib into a 
library and link your program with it. Run "make" to compile the lib, and
generate the lib file libbitweaving.so. Once you are able to compile the
bitweaving library, you should link libbitweaving.so into your program, 
and make sure you have $(BITWEAVING_DIR)/include in the header search path
so that the compiler can find all public header files when compiling your 
program. See $(BITWEAVING_DIR)/examples for some example program to use 
the bitweaving library.

To run unit tests, run "make test".

Documentation is generated by Doxygen. To generate the documentation, run 
"make doc". Resulting documentation will be placed in the $(BITWEAVING_DIR)/docs
directory; open $(BITWEAVING_DIR)/docs/index.html with your web browser 
to view it.

### Library structure ###

./include
The header files in include directory (include/*.h) contains all public 
interface to the public callers. 

./src
The internal implementation of this library is in this directory. The 
public callers should not include and rely on the header/scource files 
in this directory. Those internal interfaces may be changed without 
warnings.

./tests
Unit test code.

./examples
Some example code that shows how to use these public APIs to implement 
various functions.

./docs
Generated documentation.
